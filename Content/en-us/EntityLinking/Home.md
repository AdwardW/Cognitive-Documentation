# Entity Linking Intelligence Service API

Welcome to the Microsoft Project Oxford Entity Linking Intelligence Service, a web service that was created to help developers with tasks relating to entity linking.

## Entity Linking

Sometimes in different contexts, a word might be used as a named entity, a verb, or another word form within a given sentence. For example, in the case where “times” is a named entity, it still may refer to two separately distinguishable entities, such as “The New York Times” or “Times Square”. Given a specific paragraph of text within a document, the Entity Linking Intelligence Service will recognize and identify each separate entity based on the context.  

The following figure below shows an example of entity linking. More specifically, when using Wikipedia, the Entity Linking Intelligence Service detects all entities mentioned within the input text, and then subsequently links them to each reference point according to the page ID.
