# Create a Human Review Team #
Enter a team name to create a human review team that will review moderation results, make labeling changes if necessary, and submit their decisions. The team name can only contain letters and numbers (no spaces or special characters). You can also invite others to join by entering multiple email addresses separated by commas.

## Team ##

After you have sent out invites, you can monitor them, change permissions for team members, and invite additional users on the screens shown below. These screens are also accessible from the Settings TAB. Users can be either administrators or reviewers. The difference between the two roles is that administrators can invite other users, while reviewers cannot.
