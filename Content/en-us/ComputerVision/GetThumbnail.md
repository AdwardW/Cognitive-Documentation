# Get Thumbnail

Thumbnail is a small representation of the original image. Varied devices (Phone, tablets, PC) create a need for different UX layouts and thumbnail size needs. This service helps in solving this problem.

The Algorithm works as follows:

* Removes distracting elements from the image and recognizes the main object
* Crops the image based on identified “Region of Interest”
* Changes the aspect ratio to fit the target thumbnail dimensions
