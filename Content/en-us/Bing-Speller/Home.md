# Spell Check API

Welcome to Spell Check API which performs contextual spell checking for any text and provides inline suggestions for misspelled words. 

## What is special about our 3rd generation spell-checker?

What’s the difference between regular spell-checkers and Bing’s 3rd generation spell-checker? Current spell-checkers rely on verifying spelling and grammar against dictionary-based rule sets which get updated and expanded periodically. In other words, the spell-checker is only as strong as the dictionary that supports it, and the editorial staff who supports the dictionary. You know this type of spell-checker from Microsoft Word and other word processors.

In contrast, the Bing team has developed a web-based spell-checker that leverages machine learning and statistical machine translation to dynamically train a constantly-evolving and highly-contextual algorithm to provide spell checking on-demand for almost any word or phrase that exists on the web. 

The OneSpeller team, in partnership with Office Online, has adapted this technology to any number of word processing scenarios, texting, web form entries and search. Our spell-checker is based on a massive corpus of web searches and documents.

This spell-checker can handle any word processing scenario: 
* 	Recognizes slang and informal language
* 	Recognizes common name errors in context
* 	Corrects word breaking issues with a single flag
* 	Is able to correct homophones* in context, and other difficult to spot errors
* 	Supports new brands, digital entertainment and popular expressions as they emerge

*) Words that sound the same but differ in meaning and spelling, for example “see” and “sea”.
 
Bing partnered with Project Oxford to make this service available to you. To help you get started with this supporting technology for all your word processing needs on PC or mobile apps, a new example application will soon be added. Check back soon.

## Language support
Spell Check API currently supports U.S. English with other English locales as well as Chinese, Spanish, and other languages soon to follow. This page will be updated as new languages are added.
